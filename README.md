# AuraShow (Work in Progress)
**Dynamic Ambient Display & Weather-Integrated Slideshow**

### 📌 Overview
AuraShow is an ambient display application designed to transform a charging mobile device into a functional desktop companion. It cycles through a user-curated image library while overlaying real-time weather effects and environmental data. 

### 🛠 Technical Pillars
* **Real-Time Data Integration:** Architecting an asynchronous system to fetch and parse weather data via external APIs.
* **Dynamic Visual Overlays:** Developing a layer-based rendering system that applies visual "weather effects" (rain, fog, sun glares) as an overlay on top of images.
* **Ambient State Logic:** Implementing power-state detection to trigger display mode automatically when the device is placed on a wireless charger.

### 🚀 Development Status
* **Current Phase:** Implementing new slideshow transitions
* **Active Tasks:** Determining what transitions to implement
